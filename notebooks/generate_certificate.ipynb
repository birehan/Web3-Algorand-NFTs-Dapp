The authors provide a clear narrative, articulating the practical challenges in robotics and how ROS was conceived in response to the scalability and integrative needs of modern robotics research and development. The philosophical underpinnings of ROS—peer-to-peer, tools-based, multi-lingual, thin, and free and open-source—are thoroughly discussed, showcasing the distinct set of design goals that differentiate ROS from other frameworks.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the major strengths of this paper is its thoughtful explanation of the design philosophy behind ROS. The peer-to-peer connectivity, support for multiple programming languages, and independence from any centralized server are particularly notable features that enhance flexibility and scalability. The discussion on the microkernel design with the emphasis on a suite of tools, rather than a monolithic application, further demonstrates the authors\\' commitment to creating a stable and manageable system capable of resourceful debugging and modular development.\\\\n\\\\nThe paper also excels in elucidating ROS\\'s practical applications through several use cases, effectively demonstrating how it simplifies complex robotic functions, data logging, playback, and collaborative development. The inclusion of thorough examples, such as node debugging, visualization, and handling transformations with the tf system, provides a clear context for understanding ROS\\'s capabilities and benefits.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the exposition of the ROS nomenclature—nodes, messages, topics, and services—and its operational instances give readers an adequate grasp of how ROS components interact seamlessly to form a robust robotic system. The authors also navigate the potential pitfalls and limitations of tightly integrated systems by promoting code reuse through standalone libraries, a move that encourages the system\\'s adaptability across a broad range of robotics projects.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, the paper is not only informative but also inspires further exploration into the ROS framework. It strikes a commendable balance between technical detail and high-level conceptual discussion, making it a must-read for anyone involved in robotic software development. The open-source ethos is an overarching theme that promises a collaborative and innovative future for the ROS community, with the potential to significantly advance the field of robotics.\"\\n    }\\n}'"

    "Abstract— This paper gives an overview of ROS, an open-\n",
    "source robot operating system. ROS is not an operating system\n",
    "in the traditional sense of process management and scheduling;\n",
    "rather, it provides a structured communications layer above\n",
    "the host operating systems of a heterogenous compute cluster.\n",
    "In this paper, we discuss how ROS relates to existing robot\n",
    "software frameworks, and briefly overview some of the available\n",
    "application software which uses ROS.\n",
    "I. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Writing software for robots is difficult, particularly as the\n",
    "scale and scope of robotics continues to grow. Different\n",
    "types of robots can have wildly varying hardware, making\n",
    "code reuse nontrivial. On top of this, the sheer size of the\n",
    "required code can be daunting, as it must contain a deep\n",
    "stack starting from driver-level software and continuing up\n",
    "through perception, abstract reasoning, and beyond. Since the\n",
    "required breadth of expertise is well beyond the capabilities\n",
    "of any single researcher, robotics software architectures must\n",
    "also support large-scale software integration efforts.\n",
    "To meet these challenges, many robotics researchers, in-\n",
    "cluding ourselves, have previously created a wide variety\n",
    "of frameworks to manage complexity and facilitate rapid\n",
    "prototyping of software for experiments, resulting in the\n",
    "many robotic software systems currently used in academia\n",
    "and industry [1]. Each of these frameworks was designed for\n",
    "a particular purpose, perhaps in response to perceived weak-\n",
    "nesses of other available frameworks, or to place emphasis\n",
    "on aspects which were seen as most important in the design\n",
    "process.\n",
    "ROS, the framework described in this paper, is also the\n",
    "product of tradeoffs and prioritizations made during its de-\n",
    "sign cycle. We believe its emphasis on large-scale integrative\n",
    "robotics research will be useful in a wide variety of situations\n",
    "as robotic systems grow ever more complex. In this paper,\n",
    "we discuss the design goals of ROS, how our implementation\n",
    "works towards them, and demonstrate how ROS handles\n",
    "several common use cases of robotics software development.\n",
    "II. DESIGN GOALS\n",
    "We do not claim that ROS is the best framework for\n",
    "all robotics software. In fact, we do not believe that such\n",
    "a framework exists; the field of robotics is far too broad\n",
    "for a single solution. ROS was designed to meet a specific\n",
    "set of challenges encountered when developing large-scale\n",
    "Fig. 1.\n",
    "A typical ROS network configuration\n",
    "service robots as part of the STAIR project [2] at Stanford\n",
    "University1 and the Personal Robots Program [3] at Willow\n",
    "Garage,2 but the resulting architecture is far more general\n",
    "than the service-robot and mobile-manipulation domains.\n",
    "The philosophical goals of ROS can be summarized as:\n",
    "• Peer-to-peer\n",
    "• Tools-based\n",
    "• Multi-lingual\n",
    "• Thin\n",
    "• Free and Open-Source\n",
    "To our knowledge, no existing framework has this same\n",
    "set of design criteria. In this section, we will elaborate these\n",
    "philosophies and shows how they influenced the design and\n",
    "implementation of ROS.\n",
    "A. Peer-to-Peer\n",
    "A system built using ROS consists of a number of pro-\n",
    "cesses, potentially on a number of different hosts, connected\n",
    "at runtime in a peer-to-peer topology. Although frameworks\n",
    "based on a central server (e.g., CARMEN [4]) can also re-\n",
    "alize the benefits of the multi-process and multi-host design,\n",
    "a central data server is problematic if the computers are\n",
    "connected in a heterogenous network.\n",
    "For example, on the large service robots for which ROS\n",
    "was designed, there are typically several onboard computers\n",
    "connected via ethernet. This network segment is bridged\n",
    "via wireless LAN to high-power offboard machines that\n",
    "are running computation-intensive tasks such as computer\n",
    "vision or speech recognition (Figure 1). Running the central\n",
    "server either onboard or offboard would result in unnecessary\n",
    "1 http://stair.stanford.edu\n",
    "2 http://pr.willowgarage.comtraffic flowing across the (slow) wireless link, because many\n",
    "message routes are fully contained in the subnets either\n",
    "onboard or offboard the robot. In contrast, peer-to-peer\n",
    "connectivity, combined with buffering or “fanout” software\n",
    "modules where necessary, avoids the issue entirely.\n",
    "The peer-to-peer topology requires some sort of lookup\n",
    "mechanism to allow processes to find each other at runtime.\n",
    "We call this the name service, or master, and will describe\n",
    "it in more detail shortly.\n",
    "B. Multi-lingual\n",
    "When writing code, many individuals have preferences for\n",
    "some programming languages above others. These prefer-\n",
    "ences are the result of personal tradeoffs between program-\n",
    "ming time, ease of debugging, syntax, runtime efficiency,\n",
    "and a host of other reasons, both technical and cultural. For\n",
    "these reasons, we have designed ROS to be language-neutral.\n",
    "ROS currently supports four very different languages: C++,\n",
    "Python, Octave, and LISP, with other language ports in\n",
    "various states of completion.\n",
    "The ROS specification is at the messaging layer, not any\n",
    "deeper. Peer-to-peer connection negotiation and configura-\n",
    "tion occurs in XML-RPC, for which reasonable implemen-\n",
    "tations exist in most major languages. Rather than provide\n",
    "a C-based implementation with stub interfaces generated\n",
    "for all major languages, we prefer instead to implement\n",
    "ROS natively in each target language, to better follow the\n",
    "conventions of each language. However, in some cases it is\n",
    "expedient to add support for a new language by wrapping\n",
    "an existing library: the Octave client is implemented by\n",
    "wrapping the ROS C++ library.\n",
    "To support cross-language development, ROS uses a sim-\n",
    "ple, language-neutral interface definition language (IDL) to\n",
    "describe the messages sent between modules. The IDL uses\n",
    "(very) short text files to describe fields of each message,\n",
    "and allows composition of messages, as illustrated by the\n",
    "complete IDL file for a point cloud message:\n",
    "Header header\n",
    "Point32[] pts\n",
    "ChannelFloat32[] chan\n",
    "Code generators for each supported language then generate\n",
    "native implementations which “feel” like native objects, and\n",
    "are automatically serialized and deserialized by ROS as\n",
    "messages are sent and received. This saves considerable\n",
    "programmer time and errors: the previous 3-line IDL file\n",
    "automatically expands to 137 lines of C++, 96 lines of\n",
    "Python, 81 lines of Lisp, and 99 lines of Octave. Because the\n",
    "messages are generated automatically from such simple text\n",
    "files, it becomes easy to enumerate new types of messages.\n",
    "At time of writing, the known ROS-based codebases contain\n",
    "over four hundred types of messages, which transport data\n",
    "ranging from sensor feeds to object detections to maps.\n",
    "The end result is a language-neutral message processing\n",
    "scheme where different languages can be mixed and matched\n",
    "as desired.\n",
    "C. Tools-based\n",
    "In an effort to manage the complexity of ROS, we have\n",
    "opted for a microkernel design, where a large number of\n",
    "small tools are used to build and run the various ROS com-\n",
    "ponents, rather than constructing a monolithic development\n",
    "and runtime environment.\n",
    "These tools perform various tasks, e.g., navigate the source\n",
    "code tree, get and set configuration parameters, visualize\n",
    "the peer-to-peer connection topology, measure bandwidth\n",
    "utilization, graphically plot message data, auto-generate doc-\n",
    "umentation, and so on. Although we could have implemented\n",
    "core services such as a global clock and a logger inside\n",
    "the master module, we have attempted to push everything\n",
    "into separate modules. We believe the loss in efficiency is\n",
    "more than offset by the gains in stability and complexity\n",
    "management.\n",
    "D. Thin\n",
    "As eloquently described in [5], most existing robotics\n",
    "software projects contain drivers or algorithms which could\n",
    "be reusable outside of the project. Unfortunately, due to\n",
    "a variety of reasons, much of this code has become so\n",
    "entangled with the middleware that it is difficult to “extract”\n",
    "its functionality and re-use it outside of its original context.\n",
    "To combat this tendency, we encourage all driver and\n",
    "algorithm development to occur in standalone libraries that\n",
    "have no dependencies on ROS. The ROS build system\n",
    "performs modular builds inside the source code tree, and\n",
    "its use of CMake makes it comparatively easy to follow this\n",
    "“thin” ideology. Placing virtually all complexity in libraries,\n",
    "and only creating small executables which expose library\n",
    "functionality to ROS, allows for easier code extraction and\n",
    "reuse beyond its original intent. As an added benefit, unit\n",
    "testing is often far easier when code is factored into libraries,\n",
    "as standalone test programs can be written to exercise various\n",
    "features of the library.\n",
    "ROS re-uses code from numerous other open-source\n",
    "projects, such as the drivers, navigation system, and sim-\n",
    "ulators from the Player project [6], vision algorithms from\n",
    "OpenCV [7], and planning algorithms from OpenRAVE [8],\n",
    "among many others. In each case, ROS is used only to expose\n",
    "various configuration options and to route data into and out of\n",
    "the respective software, with as little wrapping or patching\n",
    "as possible. To benefit from the continual community im-\n",
    "provements, the ROS build system can automatically update\n",
    "source code from external repositories, apply patches, and\n",
    "so on.\n",
    "E. Free and Open-Source\n",
    "The full source code of ROS is publicly available. We\n",
    "believe this to be critical to facilitate debugging at all levels\n",
    "of the software stack. While proprietary environments such\n",
    "as Microsoft Robotics Studio [9] and Webots [10] have\n",
    "many commendable attributes, we feel there is no substitute\n",
    "for a fully open platform. This is particularly true when\n",
    "hardware and many levels of software are being designed\n",
    "and debugged in parallel.ROS is distributed under the terms of the BSD license,\n",
    "which allows the development of both non-commercial and\n",
    "commercial projects. ROS passes data between modules\n",
    "using inter-process communications, and does not require\n",
    "that modules link together in the same executable. As such,\n",
    "systems built around ROS can use fine-grain licensing of\n",
    "their various components: individual modules can incorpo-\n",
    "rate software protected by various licenses ranging from GPL\n",
    "to BSD to proprietary, but license “contamination” ends at\n",
    "the module boundary.\n",
    "III. N OMENCLATURE\n",
    "The fundamental concepts of the ROS implementation are\n",
    "nodes, messages, topics, and services,\n",
    "Nodes are processes that perform computation. ROS is\n",
    "designed to be modular at a fine-grained scale: a system\n",
    "is typically comprised of many nodes. In this context, the\n",
    "term “node” is interchangable with “software module.” Our\n",
    "use of the term “node” arises from visualizations of ROS-\n",
    "based systems at runtime: when many nodes are running, it\n",
    "is convenient to render the peer-to-peer communications as\n",
    "a graph, with processes as graph nodes and the peer-to-peer\n",
    "links as arcs.\n",
    "Nodes communicate with each other by passing messages.\n",
    "A message is a a strictly typed data structure. Standard\n",
    "primitive types (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) are\n",
    "supported, as are arrays of primitive types and constants.\n",
    "Messages can be composed of other messages, and arrays of\n",
    "other messages, nested arbritrarily deep.\n",
    "A node sends a message by publishing it to a given topic,\n",
    "which is simply a string such as “odometry” or “map.” A\n",
    "node that is interested in a certain kind of data will subscribe\n",
    "to the appropriate topic. There may be multiple concurrent\n",
    "publishers and subscribers for a single topic, and a single\n",
    "node may publish and/or subscribe to multiple topics. In\n",
    "general, publishers and subscribers are not aware of each\n",
    "others’ existence.\n",
    "The simplest communications are along pipelines:\n",
    "microphone\n",
    "speech recognition\n",
    "dialog manager\n",
    "speech synthesis\n",
    "speaker\n",
    "However, graphs are usually far more complex, often con-\n",
    "taining cycles and one-to-many or many-to-many connec-\n",
    "tions.\n",
    "Although the topic-based publish-subscribe model is a\n",
    "flexible communications paradigm, its “broadcast” routing\n",
    "scheme is not appropriate for synchronous transactions,\n",
    "which can simplify the design of some nodes. In ROS, we\n",
    "call this a service, defined by a string name and a pair\n",
    "of strictly typed messages: one for the request and one for\n",
    "the response. This is analogous to web services, which are\n",
    "defined by URIs and have request and response documents\n",
    "of well-defined types. Note that, unlike topics, only one node\n",
    "can advertise a service of any particular name: there can only\n",
    "be one service called ”classify image”, for example, just as\n",
    "there can only be one web service at any given URI.\n",
    "IV. U SE C ASES\n",
    "In this section, we will describe a number of common\n",
    "scenarios encountered when using robotic software frame-\n",
    "works. The open architecture of ROS allows for the creation\n",
    "of a wide variety of tools; in describing the ROS approach\n",
    "to these use cases, we will also be introducing a number of\n",
    "the tools designed to be used with ROS.\n",
    "A. Debugging a single node\n",
    "When performing robotics research, often the scope of\n",
    "the investigation is limited to a well-defined area of the\n",
    "system, such as a node which performs some type of\n",
    "planning, reasoning, perception, or control. However, to get\n",
    "a robotic system up and running for experiments, a much\n",
    "larger software ecosystem must exist. For example, to do\n",
    "vision-based grasping experiments, drivers must be running\n",
    "for the camera(s) and manipulator(s), and any number of\n",
    "intermediate processing nodes (e.g., object recognizers, pose\n",
    "detectors, trajectory planners) must also be up and running.\n",
    "This adds a significant amount of difficulty to integrative\n",
    "robotics research.\n",
    "ROS is designed to minimize the difficulty of debugging\n",
    "in such settings, as its modular structure allows nodes\n",
    "undergoing active development to run alongside pre-existing,\n",
    "well-debugged nodes. Because nodes connect to each other\n",
    "at runtime, the graph can be dynamically modified. In the\n",
    "previous example of vision-based grasping, a graph with\n",
    "perhaps a dozen nodes is required to provide the infras-\n",
    "tructure. This “infrastructure” graph can be started and left\n",
    "running during an entire experimental session. Only the\n",
    "node(s) undergoing source code modification need to be\n",
    "periodically restarted, at which time ROS silently handles\n",
    "the graph modifications. This can result in a massive increase\n",
    "in productivity, particularly as the robotic system becomes\n",
    "more complex and interconnected.\n",
    "To emphasize, altering the graph in ROS simply amounts\n",
    "to starting or stopping a process. In debugging settings, this\n",
    "is typically done at the command line or in a debugger. The\n",
    "ease of inserting and removing nodes from a running ROS-\n",
    "based system is one of its most powerful and fundamental\n",
    "features.\n",
    "B. Logging and playback\n",
    "Research in robotic perception is often done most con-\n",
    "veniently with logged sensor data, to permit controlledcomparisons of various algorithms and to simplify the ex-\n",
    "perimental procedure. ROS supports this approach by pro-\n",
    "viding generic logging and playback functionality. Any ROS\n",
    "message stream can be dumped to disk and later replayed.\n",
    "Importantly, this can all be done at the command line; it\n",
    "requires no modification of the source code of any pieces of\n",
    "software in the graph.\n",
    "For example, the following network graph could be\n",
    "quickly set up to collect a dataset for visual-odometry\n",
    "research:\n",
    "robot\n",
    "camera\n",
    "get tedious. To allow for “packaged” functionality such as a\n",
    "navigation system, ROS provides a tool called roslaunch,\n",
    "which reads an XML description of a graph and instantiates\n",
    "the graph on the cluster, optionally on specific hosts. The\n",
    "end-user experience of launching the navigation system then\n",
    "boils down to\n",
    "roslaunch navstack.xml\n",
    "and a single Ctrl-C will gracefully close all five processes.\n",
    "This functionality can also significantly aid sharing and reuse\n",
    "of large demonstrations of integrative robotics research, as\n",
    "the set-up and tear-down of large distributed systems can be\n",
    "easily replicated.\n",
    "D. Collaborative Development\n",
    "logger\n",
    "visualizer\n",
    "The resulting message dump can be played back into a\n",
    "different graph, which contains the node under development:\n",
    "logger\n",
    "vision research\n",
    "visualizer\n",
    "As before, node instantiation can be performed simply by\n",
    "launching a process; it can be done at the command line, in\n",
    "a debugger, from a script, etc.\n",
    "To facilitate logging and monitoring of systems distributed\n",
    "across many hosts, the rosconsole library builds upon the\n",
    "Apache project’s log4cxx system to provide a convenient\n",
    "and elegant logging interface, allowing printf-style diag-\n",
    "nostic messages to be routed through the network to a single\n",
    "stream called rosout.\n",
    "C. Packaged subsystems\n",
    "Some areas of robotics research, such as indoor robot\n",
    "navigation, have matured to the point where “out of the\n",
    "box” algorithms can work reasonably well. ROS leverages\n",
    "the algorithms implemented in the Player project to provide\n",

    "Although each node can be run from the command line, re-\n",
    "peatedly typing the commands to launch the processes could\n",
    "Due to the vast scope of robotics and artificial intelligence,\n",
    "collaboration between researchers is necessary in order to\n",
    "build large systems. To support collaborative development,\n",
    "the ROS software system is organized into packages. Our\n",
    "definition of “package” is deliberately open-ended: a ROS\n",
    "package is simply a directory which contains an XML file\n",
    "describing the package and stating any dependencies.\n",
    "A collection of ROS packages is a directory tree with ROS\n",
    "packages at the leaves: a ROS package repository may thus\n",
    "contain an arbitrarily complex scheme of subdirectories. For\n",
    "example, one ROS repository has root directories including\n",
    "“nav,” “vision,” and “motion planning,” each of which con-\n",
    "tains many packages as subdirectories.\n",
    "ROS provides a utility called rospack to query and\n",
    "inspect the code tree, search dependencies, find packages\n",
    "by name, etc. A set of shell expansions called rosbash is\n",
    "provided for convenience, accelerating command-line navi-\n",
    "gation of the system.\n",
    "The rospack utility is designed to support simultane-\n",
    "ous development across multiple ROS package repositories.\n",
    "Environment variables are used to define the roots of local\n",
    "copies of ROS package repositories, and rospack crawls\n",
    "the package trees as necessary. Recursive builds, supported\n",
    "by the rosmake utility, allow for cross-package library\n",

    "can be maintained and developed on its own schedule by its\n",
    "own team of developers.\n",

    "across several publicly-viewable repositories, and hundreds\n",
    "more likely exist in private repositories at various institutions\n",
    "and companies. The ROS core is distributed as its own\n",

    "communications infrastructure and graph-management tools.\n",
    "Software which actually builds robotic systems using ROS\n",
    "is provided in a second repository, also on Sourceforge:\n",

    "shows a hierarchical multi-robot control system constructed\n",
    "by simply instantiating multiple navigation stacks, each in\n",
    "their own namespace:\n",
    "E. Visualization and Monitoring\n",
    "While designing and debugging robotics software, it often\n",
    "becomes necessary to observe some state while the system\n",
    "is running. Although printf is a familiar technique for\n",
    "debugging programs on a single machine, this technique can\n",
    "be difficult to extend to large-scale distributed systems, and\n",
    "can become unwieldly for general-purpose monitoring.\n",
    "Instead, ROS can exploit the dynamic nature of the\n",
    "connectivity graph to “tap into” any message stream on\n",
    "the system. Furthermore, the decoupling between publishers\n",
    "and subscribers allows for the creation of general-purpose\n",
    "visualizers. Simple programs can be written which subscribe\n",
    "to a particular topic name and plot a particular type of data,\n",
    "such as laser scans or images. However, a more powerful\n",
    "concept is a visualization program which uses a plugin\n",
    "architecture: this is done in the rviz program, which is\n",
    "distributed with ROS. Visualization panels can be dynami-\n",
    "cally instantiated to view a large variety of datatypes, such\n",
    "as images, point clouds, geometric primitives (such as object\n",
    "recognition results), render robot poses and trajectories, etc.\n",
    "Plugins can be easily written to display more types of data.\n",
    "A native ROS port is provided for Python, a dynamically-\n",
    "typed language supporting introspection. Using Python, a\n",
    "powerful utility called rostopic was written to filter\n",
    "messages using expressions supplied on the command line,\n",
    "resulting in an instantly customizable “message tap” which\n",
    "can convert any portion of any data stream into a text stream.\n",
    "These text streams can be piped to other UNIX command-\n",
    "line tools such as grep, sed, and awk, to create complex\n",
    "monitoring tools without writing any code.\n",
    "Similarly, a tool called rxplot provides the functionality\n",
    "of a virtual oscilloscope, plotting any variable in real-time as\n",
    "a time series, again through the use of Python introspection\n",
    "and expression evaluation.\n",
    "F. Composition of functionality\n",
    "In ROS, a “stack” of software is a cluster of nodes that\n",
    "does something useful, as was illustrated in the navigation\n",
    "example. As previously described, ROS is able to instantiate\n",
    "a cluster of nodes with a single command, once the cluster\n",
    "is described in an XML file. However, sometimes multiple\n",
    "instantiations of a cluster are desired. For example, in multi-\n",
    "robot experiments, a navigation stack will be needed for\n",
    "each robot in the system, and robots with humanoid torsos\n",
    "will likely need to instantiate two identical arm controllers.\n",
    "ROS supports this by allowing nodes and entire roslaunch\n",
    "cluster-description files to be pushed into a child namespace,\n",
    "thus ensuring that there can be no name collisions. Essen-\n",
    "tially, this prepends a string (the namespace) to all node,\n",
    "The previous graph was automatically generated by the\n",
    "rxgraph tool, which can inspect and monitor any ROS\n",
    "graph at runtime. Its output renders nodes as ovals, topics as\n",
    "squares, and connectivity as arcs.\n",
    "G. Transformations\n",
    "Robotic systems often need to track spatial relationships\n",
    "for a variety of reasons: between a mobile robot and some\n",
    "fixed frame of reference for localization, between the various\n",
    "sensor frames and manipulator frames, or to place frames on\n",
    "target objects for control purposes.\n",
    "To simplify and unify the treatment of spatial frames,\n",
    "a transformation system has been written for ROS, called\n",
    "tf. The tf system constructs a dynamic transformation\n",
    "tree which relates all frames of reference in the system.\n",
    "As information streams in from the various subsystems of\n",
    "the robot (joint encoders, localization algorithms, etc.), the\n",
    "tf system can produce streams of transformations between\n",
    "nodes on the tree by constructing a path between the desired\n",
    "nodes and performing the necessary calculations.\n",
    "For example, the tf system can be used to easily generate\n",
    "point clouds in a stationary “map” frame from laser scans\n",
    "received by a tilting laser scanner on a moving robot. As\n",
    "another example, consider a two-armed robot: the tf system\n",
    "can stream the transformation from a wrist camera on one\n",
    "robotic arm to the moving tool tip of the second arm of the\n",
    "robot. These types of computations can be tedious, error-\n",
    "prone, and difficult to debug when coded by hand, but the\n",
    "tf implementation, combined with the dynamic messaging\n",
    "infrastructure of ROS, allows for an automated, systematic\n",
    "approach.V. C ONCLUSION\n",
    "We have designed ROS to support our philosophy of\n",
    "modular, tools-based software development. We anticipate\n",
    "that its open-ended design can be extended and built upon by\n",
    "others to build robot software systems which can be useful\n",
    "to a variety of hardware platforms, research settings, and\n",
